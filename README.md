# Slash Lobby Spigot
 This is a simple /Lobby command plugin for spigot.
 To use this plugin you need to have a bungee cord/velocity proxy, you need a lobby server named "lobby1", and a server that you want the player to run the /lobby command in. The plugin goes in the plugins folder on the server that you want the player to run it in. (restart your server), now when the player runs /lobby it will send the player to the lobby server.
