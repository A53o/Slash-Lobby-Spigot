# Slash Lobby Spigot
 This is a simple /Lobby command plugin for spigot.
 to use this plugin you need to have a bungee cord proxy, and you need a lobby server named "lobby1", and a server that you want the player to run the /lobby command in, the plugin goes in the plugins folder on the server that you want the player to run the /lobby command in (restart your server), now when the player runs /lobby it will send the player to the lobby server.
